This repository hosts the code for processing deep optical CCD images stored in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format to determine galaxy number counts in the local universe. The program detects galaxies, measures their brightness, and computes their apparent magnitudes from these images.

Extention works including calculate the two point correlation function of galaxies.
